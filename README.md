# Therapy with Dee Macey

This website was created as my first real-world project for a therapist website. I used Next.js and Tailwind CSS as well as Daisy UI to style my components.

I thoroughly enjoyed seeing through my first real-world project to completion.

# Description

In this website you can find information regarding Rapid Transformational Therapy, by Marissa Peer and RTT&#174; therapist Macey Dee.

## How to install

In the terminal, start by typing "npm i". This will install all the dependencies and dev dependencies required. To run the app, 'npm run dev'.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Usage

Through 'npm run dev' the website will run. The local host server will start on local host 3003. You can also run 'npm start'.

## Deploy on Vercel

I used Vercel for deployment. [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
